Authors: Thipok Cholsaipant @thipokch, Claire Kantner @ckantner (gitlabs), Tenma Rollins @sityaran, Collin Crow @Cromalin (gitlabs), and 
  -> Most of the code was commited from my computer due to our team's overall lack of experience with handling merge conflicts, but all these wonderful people helped make this application!

To use : 
  1. Accept microphone usage, allow it to use the default recording/input device! And then changed the input device as needed to get the desired audio source.
    -> For example: Windows 10, Chrome: Set default recording device to Stereo Out OR Choose Stereo Out from Chrome microphone settings.
  2. Play audio, click through to view different visualizations! 
    -> Some are interactive, so try moving the mouse around and hitting space bar on some of those visualizations, especially the ones that appear blank!
    
To Do :
  - Clean up JS code style to be consistent and up to standards.
  - Optimize visualizations to have both a) more unique/pleasing color palletes and b) smoother transitions between animation frames!
  - Add a GUI for ease of customizing audio sources
  - Restructure Web Audio API usage ? To increase modularity of visualization functions
